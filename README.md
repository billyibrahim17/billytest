# 0G Testnet V3 Deployment Script Examples

This repository provides example scripts for deploying a simple ERC20 token (`MyToken.sol`) to the 0G Testnet V3 (Chain ID: 16601) using popular development frameworks:

*   **[Truffle](./truffle/README.md)**
*   **[Hardhat](./hardhat/README.md)**
*   **[Foundry](./foundry/README.md)**

Each directory contains a self-contained example with specific setup and deployment instructions in its respective `README.md` file.

## Contract

The `MyToken.sol` contract is a basic ERC20 token with an initial supply minted to the deployer, using OpenZeppelin Contracts v5.0.2.

*   **RPC URL:** https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai
*   **Chain ID:** 16601
*   **Token Symbol:** OG
*   **Explorer:** [Chainscan](https://chainscan-galileo.0g.ai/)

## General Requirements

*   Node.js/npm (for Truffle and Hardhat)
